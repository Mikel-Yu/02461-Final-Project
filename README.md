# 02461-Final-Project
Image Recognition with YOLOv8


Proposals:

# Recognition of brain tumors

Amount of images needed for detecting brain tumors

Recognition of plastic bottles

# Object detection for self-driving cars: passengers, cars, traffic lights, bikes / License plate detection

Offside detection in football

Travel detection in basketball

# Gradient descent in images: adversarial machine learning

Comparison of different image recognition models: time and accuracy

Text detection - from paper to text

Text/code detection - from screenshots

# Chessboard transcription - from live camera feed to virtual chessboard

Sudoku solver
