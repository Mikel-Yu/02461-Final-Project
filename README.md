# 02461-Final-Project
Image Recognition with YOLOv8


Initial Proposals:

Recognition of brain tumors, Amount of images needed for detecting brain tumors, Recognition of plastic bottles, Object detection for self-driving cars: passengers, cars, traffic lights, bikes / License plate detection, Offside detection in football, Travel detection in basketball, Gradient descent in images: adversarial machine learning, Comparison of different image recognition models: time and accuracy, Text detection - from paper to text, Text/code detection - from screenshots, and Sudoku solver.

# Final Choice: Chessboard transcription - from live camera feed to virtual chessboard
