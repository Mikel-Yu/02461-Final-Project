# Chessboard transcription 

This repository contains our final project for an introductory course to intelligent systems.
The script takes an image of a chessboard and virtually transcribes the concurrent game state of the board. Due to the small dataset, unfortunately, it only works properly when the picture is taken from the exact angle and distance used in the dataset.
